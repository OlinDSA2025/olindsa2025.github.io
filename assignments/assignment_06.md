## Overview

This assignment will consist of an individual deep dive on an application or algorithm related to the themes of this class.

## Areas of Investigation

For your project, you should choose one or more of the following areas of investigation.  In terms of scoping, this should equate to about 10 hours of work (not including the time to come up with the project topic and write the proposal).

* Learn about and (likely) implement a new algorithm.  You could choose an algorithm that has been known in the literature for a while: All Pairs Shortest Path, Ford-Fulkerson for maximum network flow, Page Rank, Fast-Fourier Transform, Viterbi Algorithm for Hidden Markov Models, K-Means clustering, Policy Iteration for optimal planning, Simplex Method for linear programming, etc.  You could choose an algorithm from a research paper of interest.
* Apply an algorithm we already learned about to an interesting problem.  Take one of the algorithms you've already implemented and try it on a non-trivial problem.
* Take one of the assignments further.  You might try various optimizations to your code to improve runtime (make sure to pair this with benchmarks that show the change in performance).  You might want to implement additional features or variants of your algorithm (e.g., additional sorting algorithms).
* Do some research to determine how a particular algorithm is being applied currently or has been applied in the past.

## Deliverables

### Project Proposal (2 points)

Turn in a project proposal that lays out your plan for the project.  Clearly specify what your project will entail, what deliverables you will create, and how much time you think each part will take.  With your proposal, include a rubric for grading your project (what does "A"-level performance look like, "B"-level, etc.).

### Other Deliverables (13 points)

You are required to include a brief summary of what you did for the project and a summary of all other deliverables.   Some other deliverables you might have (***this is a list of options... you will not have all of these***):
* Kotlin code (so you will want to send a link to a repository).
* A summary of how an algorithm a particular algorithm you studied works
* A report on former and current applications of your algorithm.
* A report on the changes in performance that resulted in optimizing your code.
* A report that summarizes an application or experiment you did.
