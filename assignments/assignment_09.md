## Overview

In this assignment you will have a chance to customize the course to meet your learning goals.  You can work on this project individually or as a member of a team.

## Areas of Investigation

For your project, you should choose one or more of the following areas of investigation.  In terms of scoping, this should equate to about 20 hours of work (not including the time to come up with the project topic and write the proposal).

* Learn about and (likely) implement a new algorithm.  You could choose an algorithm that has been known in the literature for a while: All Pairs Shortest Path, Ford-Fulkerson for maximum network flow, Page Rank, Fast-Fourier Transform, Viterbi Algorithm for Hidden Markov Models, K-Means clustering, Policy Iteration for optimal planning, Simplex Method for linear programming, etc.  You could choose an algorithm from a research paper of interest.
* Apply an algorithm we already learned about to an interesting problem.  Take one of the algorithms you've already implemented and try it on a non-trivial problem.
* Take one of the assignments further.  You might try various optimizations to your code to improve runtime (make sure to pair this with benchmarks that show the change in performance).  You might want to implement additional features or variants of your algorithm (e.g., additional sorting algorithms).
* Do some research to determine how a particular algorithm is being applied currently or has been applied in the past.

## Deliverables

### Project Plan (5 points)

Turn in a project plan that lays out your plan for the project.  Clearly specify the following components.

* **Main Idea**: what is your project about.
* **Learning Goals**: what are you hoping to get out of this project to enrich your learning in this class.
* **Deliverables** what deliverables you will create.
* **Educational Value of Deliverables** The deliverables should help others in the course extend their knowledge.  How will you ensure that your deliverables have some component that will help others in the course learn?
* **Project schedule** Provide a rough timeline for how you will finish this work before the final event on May 2nd.

### Other Deliverables (25 points)

You are required to include a brief summary of what you did for the project and an orientation to any other deliverables (e.g., a listing of where your code lives, links to a website / video, etc.).  Your summary should also provide clear instructions so someone from the class can learn something from your project.
