## More Practice With Dynamic Programming

For the first half of class you can either work on assignment 5 or try some more dynamic programming problems.  You may not have finished the problems from last time, so feel free to do those.  You can also look for additional problems, by searching for terms like "dynamic programming sample problems".  You will get some like:
* [Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://www.techiedelight.com/longest-increasing-subsequence-using-dynamic-programming/)
* [Matrix Chain Multiplication](https://www.techiedelight.com/matrix-chain-multiplication/)

## Looking Towards Assignment 6

Assignment 6 will be a fairly short, self-directed project.  Use this link to find [the details of assignment 6](../assignments/assignment_06.md).  Let's take the rest of class to formulate some initial ideas for this assignment.  We'll also take some time to do some sharing of ideas in small groups.
