## Overview

We're going to take some time to dive into an implementation of a data structure: the Stack.  We'll get started together and then I'll let you all split off to work at your own pace.


## Arrays in Kotlin (follow up from last time)

Kotlin has an built-in ``Array`` class ([documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/arrays.html)) that can be used in much the same way as ``List`` (and mutable list).  The restrictions on ``Array`` mean that we can't add elements to it.

If we have time, we could see how we could implement some of the functions of ``MutableList`` using an ``Array``.

## Implementing a Stack Together

We're going to go through the process of implementing a stack as a class.  Once we get through this example, we should have lots of time for folks to ask questions or keep working on the homework.

The steps we will go through will involve creating a new project, creating a stack class, adding some basic functions, and testing our code through unit tests.
