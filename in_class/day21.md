## Concept Mapping DSA (30 minutes)

**Problem 1** With at least two other people (assuming you are in class), create [a concept map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_map) for this semester thus far in DSA.

We'll do a quick share out.

## Charting Your Learning (20 minutes)

**Problem 2** Look back to your learning goals you had at the beginning of the semester (I can share the entrance survey data with you if that's helpful).  How have you been progressing with respect to these learning goals?  Try to jot down a few notes with respect to each of your learning goals.  Take about 5-7 minutes to think individually, and then share with those around you.

## Charting the Course for the Rest of the Semester (50 minutes)

Data Structures and Algorithms is obviously a vast topic.  As we enter the last bit of the course, which has much more flexibility, you'll need to figure out how you want to extend / deepen your knowledge.  Perhaps you already know exactly what you want to do, but I suspect many folks would benefit from looking into some resources.  Here are some jumping off points I'd like to share.
