### Oral Quiz 2

Please remember to sign up for a slot for your oral quiz (link is in the [Canvas assignment page](https://olin.instructure.com/courses/940/assignments/17172)).  This assignment may not be done late unless you are seriously ill or have a specific accommodation.

### Reminder: final project deliverables

If you haven't already, please turn in your final project check-in 1 assignment.  If we spoke in class, but you didn't turn in the written part, please indicate that as a comment on the Canvas assignment (I will waive the late penalty if this was the case).

## Oral Quiz 2 Topic List (and some time for review)

As a reminder, this is the scope of the quiz.

> This quiz covers the material in the class post assignment 4 (Divide and Conquer, Associative Arrays and Hashing, and KD-Trees / Binary Search Trees).  If something was marked as optional, it will not be part of the quiz.

To help you in your studying, here are a list of things we covered in this part of the class.

* We continued to explore the idea of divide and conquer algorithms.  We saw some problems on [day 10](day10) that used this idea.
* You implemented Strassen's algorithm and compared its performance to the typical, $\Theta(n^3)$ approach.  We also can understand its runtime by using the master theorem.
* We learned about dynamic programming as a systematic way to solve problems (see [day 10](day10)).  We did some practice problems involving changemaking as well as stairclimbing.  On [day 11](day11) we did some more practice problems.  There are also some problems on [day 12](day12).
* You learned about the problem of DNA sequence alignment and implemented either Needleman-Wunsch or Smith-Waterman.
* We learned about the notion of [an associative array](day15) and saw two strawman methods of implementing one (association lists and array maps).  We learned about the concept of a hashing function and showed how it could be used to create an associative array (either with separate chaining or direct addressing).
* We learned about the computational complexity of various operations on a hash map.
* [We learned about the Lempel-Ziv algorithm](day16) and how it can be used as a lossless compression algorithm.
* You [implemented an associative array](../assignments/assignment_07) using a hash table.  You also either implemented Markov text analysis or Lempel-Ziv encoding.
* [You learned about the concept of a binary search tree](day17), the notion of balance in a binary search tree, and how balance relates to runtime of looking for an element in the tree.
* [You learned about red-black trees](day18), tree rotations, and how the properties of a red-black tree can be maintained by performing recoloring and rotation.
* You learned about the nearest neighbor search and k-d trees.  [You implemented your own k-d tree](../assignments/assignment_08) and explored how the runtime of k-d trees compared to brute-force search as the number of points and the dimensionality of the data change.

## Worktime

Let's use today to keep momentum on final projects.
