## Kotlin's Multiplatform Compose

I put together [an example app](https://github.com/OlinDSA2024/ComposeDemo) using [Kotlin's Multiplatform Compose](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/get-started.html) architecture.

For certain platforms, this is a nice way to create a GUI and package your app for distribution.  I'll do a quick demo of the app and show some of the project structure.

## Kotlin Linear Algebra

The [Multik](https://github.com/Kotlin/multik) library gives some matrix and linear algebra functionality to Kotlin.

I put together [a sample project](https://github.com/OlinDSA2024/MultikSample) that shows matrix multiplication as well as the discrete fourier transform.
