## Reviewing Assignment 5

A decent amount of folks are taking a late day (or possibly more) to complete assignment 5.  I'd like to form two groups.

Those that completed assignment 5 and those who are still working on it.

For those in the "completed it group", please share out any strategies that worked particularly well.  This could be a debugging technique or a specific resource that explained a concept really well.

For those in the "still working on it group", what are you hung up on?  What is working well so far?

## Getting Going on Assignment 6

The individual deep dive assignment kicks off today.  You will need to submit your project proposal by Tuesday at midnight.  I'd like to have time to review it on Wednesday, so I can give you feedback in a timely fashion.
