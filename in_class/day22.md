## Sharing Individual Project Ideation and Learning Goal Setting

In a group of four, share what you wrote for the [Individual Project Ideation and Learning Goal Setting assignment](https://olin.instructure.com/courses/761/assignments/12290).  When listening to others, ask clarifying questions both to help your understanding and possibly to help the speaker sharpen their thinking.  Be on the lookout for potential opportunities (areas where learning goals and topics are well-aligned) and potential pitfalls (where these things are misaligned).

## Team Formation

Since we have a relatively small class, I think we can improvise this.  I want to first get a sense of who wants to work on a team.  Second, I want to know who wants help finding teammates or who would be open to adding a third (if they already have a teammate).  We'll do some group brainstorming to try to get folks aligned.

## Start on Project Plan

Now you can start working on your [project plan](../assignments/assignment_09#project-plan-4-points).
