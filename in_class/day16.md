## Project Shareout

Let's take some time and share the results from the individual deep dives.  If you want to [throw some slides in this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lSqpgdcaFu5sriGwhu0AhGNUVdTFx6sZrdKep7iXp-0/edit?usp=sharing), please feel free to do so.

## Fun With Algorithms

* Learn about the [mindreader game](https://web.media.mit.edu/~guysatat/MindReader/index.html) ([originally proposed by Shannon](https://this1that1whatever.com/miscellany/mind-reader/Shannon-Mind-Reading.pdf)).  Some [related reading](https://github.com/AnandChowdhary/claude?tab=readme-ov-file).
* Learn about the [K-Means algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering).  Here is [a great visualizer for the K-Means algorithm](http://alekseynp.com/viz/k-means.html).
* Read about [Huffman Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding).  Do some examples on the board.  Check out [this really cool visualization](https://huffman-coding-online.vercel.app/).  Implement Huffman Codes in Kotlin for an alphabet of your choice (e.g., based on the probability of various characters in the English language).

More demos and visualizations
