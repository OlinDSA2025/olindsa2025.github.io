        "content": "A Note on Assignment ScopeIn general, you will be spending about 8 hours a week on homework for this class.  The first assignment, is on the lighter side, but you should still be spending at least 6 hours on it.  If you finish this assignment in less than 6 hours, please consider one of the following additional activities.  Do some problems from Advent of Code in Kotlin (note: there is a link on the useful resources page to a walkthrough of these problems).  Expand the scope of the “translating old code to Kotlin” part of the assignment.  In the “Hello Kotlin” part of the assignment, try importing a dependency and using it in your code (the Setting up Kotlin section has some information on this).Course Entry SurveyPlease fill this out.  I want to get a better sense for what you are hoping to get out of this course, what your background is, and how I can make this course work well for you.Identifying Effective Strategies for LearningWhen embarking on a course, it’s important to strategize about how to get the most out of the experience.  One might focus on how to get the best grade, but I invite you to consider the task of trying to learn as much as possible as being the primary objective (and other rewards will follow from this goal).Respond to the following prompts to get you thinking about your approach to learning in this course.  Choose a moment in your educational career (it could be an assignment or a full course) where learning went really well. What strategies did you employ that worked particularly well (e.g., working with others, trying work on your own before asking a friend, going to office hours)?  Similar to (1), which sorts of strategies have led to either less effective learning or less enjoyment of the learning experience.  Feel free to describe a few examples of what doesn’t work for you.  As this course is foundational for many aspects of computer science, the problems in this class can be easily solved with modern AI systems (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.).  One of my foundational assumptions is the process of grappling with a problem helps you internalize the important concepts, gives you more insight into how the tools you are learning can be applied in other contexts, helps you more realistically assess your own abilities, and helps you learn to better communicate your knowledge to others.  Particular methods of using AI (e.g., prompting the AI to provide answers to questions and thoughtlessly copying the answers) are unlikely to achieve the learning goals articulated previously.  Do you agree with this framing? How are you thinking about AI tools with respect to this course?  What strategies will you use in this course to be successful?  With respect to AI, what principles or strategies will you use during this course.  What do you think of some of the proposed activities for the oral quizzes?  Are these activities ones that would give you helpful feedback as to how you are performing with respect to the course material?  Would you add or subtract any of the proposed activities?  How can the teaching team support you?Hello Kotlin!Read the section on the website about Getting Set with Kotlin.Go through the Kotlin tour (you only need to do the beginner Kotlin tour).  Make sure to attempt all the exercises in the tour.  What features do you like about Kotlin?  Are there things you were expecting to find that you haven’t?  What questions do you have?  Try using the debugger (see the Getting Set with Kotlin page) for some very basic information on the debugger.  Do you have experience using interactive debuggers like this one?  Were you able to successfully launch the debugger?  Turning in your work: You don’t have to turn in the code you write for the tour.  Please let me know that you did indeed finish the tour and turn in your answers to the questions above.Translating Your Old Code to KotlinChoose a piece of code that you’ve written in a programming language other than Kotlin.  Translate the code to run in Kotlin.  For simplicity, you may want to choose some code that will not require interacting with a lot of external libraries (although the course how-to discusses how to add dependencies to your project)The code you produce should be documented and contain at least some unit tests.  Turning in your work: Include a link to a GitHub repo containing your port of the code.  Include a writeup that describes the purpose of the code and how you found the process of translating the code to Kotlin (the good, the bad, and the ugly).",

How about name, year, school, and where you’re from?Course Structure and Major Topics  Time: 2:55-3:05pmThe goal of this course is for you to learn how to frame problems using the language of computation and select appropriate data structures and algorithms to solve them.  We’ll get more into what we mean by framing problems later (there is an example later today), but for now I want to focus on the sorts of problems we will be tackling and the algorithmic strategies we will be using to solve them.Data Structures  Before talking about data structures, let’s talk about data.  What sorts data do we need to consider when designing computer algorithms?  Data structures as supports for algorithms.  Ultimately, data structures are useful to solve certain problems.  There are many properties we might care about when we select a data structure.  Can we brainstorm some of these properties as a class?  We’ll be learning about basic linked data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues), data structures to represent graphs and trees (e.g., binary search trees or heaps), and data structures that use hashing to index and retrieve data.Algorithmic Design PatternsWhile each algorithm must be tuned to the particular problem being solved, there are general algorithm types that we will encounter (e.g., some algorithms work by breaking a larger problem into smaller instances, some use a greedy approach, others are based on backtracking or graph search).Analyzing AlgorithmsWe want to develop ways to talk about the computational (how long it takes to compute a solution) and spatial (how much space is needed in a computer’s memory to compute a solution) complexity of algorithms.  We can look at these factors with both theoretical (e.g., doing some analysis to understand how long an algorithm runs based on the problem size) and empirical tools (e.g., measuring the actual time it takes an algorithm to run on a computer).Specific AlgorithmsOf course, we will learn about specific algorithms.  We’ll see algorithms from graph theory, string matching, bioinformatics, sorting, matrix multiplication, backtracking, and artificial intelligence.Applications of AlgorithmsWe’ll see some instances of how particular algorithms can be applied to solve problems in specific fields (e.g., text retrieval and indexing, bioinformatics).Algorithmic Deep DiveYou’ll be able to customize the course by taking a deep dive into a new algorithm or algorithms topic that we did not cover in the class.Implementation and TestingIn order to solidify your understanding of the material and improve your ability as a developer, we will be implementing many of our algorithms and data structures.  We’ll focus on creating unit tests as a way to create more maintainable and correct code.Algorithms in the World  Time: 3:05pm-3:30pmChoose a category of algorithms from the list below (or make up your own). You are not supposed to know all (or any) of these already!  I encourage you to choose ones you don’t know about and do some research. Alternatively, warm up with one you are familiar with and then choose one less so.  For each category you choose to look into:  What problem does the algorithm solve?  List the metrics that an algorithm designer might care about when creating an algorithm of this type.  List at least two examples of how algorithms of this type are used in the world (applications).Some examples of algorithms are listed below.  Data Compression (lossless or lossy)  Collaborative filtering (e.g., as used in recommender systems)  Encryption  Routing (e.g., of Internet traffic or for navigation instructions)  Task Assignment  Sorting  Matrix Multiplication  Fourier Analysis  Semantic search  (come up with your own…. there are so many!)  Bonus question: list all the algorithms that you and your team have interacted with since you got up this morning.Discussion of Learning Strategies and Oral Quizzes  Time: 3:30pm-3:50pmNext, I want to discuss two interrelated issues.  The first is how you can work in a way that best supports your learning this semester.  The second is how I can provide an assessment structure that provides you with useful feedback.While there are many aspects of assessment in this course, for now I want to focus on something new I’m trying this semester.  Twice this semester, I will meet with each of you for an oral quiz (each quiz is worth 10% of your grade).  My hope is that this structure will give you a better measurement of your progress over the semester.  Partially, my decision is based on mitigating what I feel are ways in which AI-based coding assistants might hinder learning in this course (e.g., if they are used as answer generators rather than coaches).  I’m not ready to nail down the full design of these quizzes, but here are some preliminary thoughts.            Activity      What’s Being Assessed              You are given a problem to solve. As you work towards a solution, you show / discuss your thought process.      Your ability to select appropriate data structures and algorithms to solve a novel problem.              You are asked to explain a section of code from one of your submitted assignments.      Your ability to internalize, and be able to verbalize to others, the coding choices you made.              You are asked to give a whiteboard talk explaining one of the class concepts.      Your fluency with the concepts in the course, your ability to distill down the important bits, and your ability to communicate clearly about course concepts.              You are given an implementation of a particular algorithm, and you must work through whether the code is correct. If it is not correct, you may suggest corrections.      Your ability to comprehend code that you didn’t write and assess its correctness.      With some folks around you, please discuss the following.  What are some learning strategies that have worked particularly well for you in the past?  Do you think they will work well in this course?  Will you use AI-based coding assistants in this course?  How will you use them to ensure you are getting the knowledge you’d like from the course?  In reaction to the table above, what other activities would be useful to include in an oral quiz and what skill would they be assessing?Having Some Fun With Algorithms  3:50pm - 4:20pmQuantifying RuntimeIn this class we’re going to be reasoning about the efficiency of our algorithms with respect to the size of the problem they are solving.  For instance, if we feed $n$ numbers into an algorithm, how long does it take the algorithm to compute a solution?  Depending on how the algorithm works, this might take $n^2$ (e.g., if we had to check all pairs of inputs against each other) or $n$ (e.g., if we only had to scan the inputs once).  In the problems below, you’ll want to come up with a procedure for solving the problem and also determine how many steps the algorithm would take to compute an answer as a function of $n$.  For the purposes of these exercises, the following operations take 1 step.  Accessing an element in a list (e.g., $a_2$)  Comparing two numbers to each other (e.g., $a_3 &gt; a_8$)Work through the peak-finding problem with a group of people sitting near you.  If you finish the first problem, you can either look into 2D peak-finding, or check out the first assignment.  The goal here is not for you to be able to jump right to the answer, but instead, to break down the problem and discuss it with those around you.Peak Finding  Credit to MIT Open Courseware 6.006 for this problemSuppose we have a list of numbers represented as a sequence $a_1, \\ldots, a_n$ with $n \\geq 2$.  For any element that isn’t either the first or the last element of this sequence, we say that element $i$ is a peak if and only if $a_i \\geq  a_{i-1}~\\text{and}~a_i \\geq a_{i+1}$.  For the elements at the ends of the sequence, we say that $a_1$ is a peak if and only $a_1 \\geq a_2$ and $a_n$ is a peak if and only if $a_n \\geq a_{n-1}$.With some folks around, you answer the following questions:Unpack the notation.  Write out a simple test case and label the values with the appropriate notation (e.g., write a list of numbers and draw an arrow to the first that says $a_1$, to the second that says $a_2$, etc.Get a feel for the condition written above.  Draw a few test cases.  When does a peak exist?  When does it not?Come up with a very simple algorithm to return the position, $i$, of a peak in a list of numbers (provided one exists).  As a function of $n$, how many elements do you have to check to determine if you have a peak?See if you can create an algorithm to find a peak faster than your first algorithm (faster in this case means it has a slower growing runtime as a function of $n$).  What techniques might be able to speed things up?  Make an argument that your algorithm is correct and see if you can start to understand how you might prove this more formally.Show / Hide Hint 1You should think about breaking the problem down into simpler instances.Show / Hide Hint 2Think recursively.  Here is a convenient link to the material from SoftDes on the matter (or call me over and we can do a quick refresher)!  What test can you perform that would allow you to recurse on a sequence half as large as the one you started with?If we changed the condition of a peak to the definition below, would your algorithm in question 3 still work?  Definition 2: For any element that isn’t either the first or the last element of this sequence, we say that element $i$ is a peak if and only if $a_i &gt; a_{i-1}~\\text{and}~a_i &gt; a_{i+1}$.  For the elements at the ends of the sequence, we say that $a_1$ is a peak if and only $a_1 &gt; a_2$ and $a_n$ is a peak if and only if $a_n &lt; a_{n-1}$.2D Peak Finding  Note: this is mostly just here for reference for the folks who are curious.  I do not expect you to be able to get to this during class time.Can we generalize the ideas from the peak-finding algorithm to 2 dimensions (i.e, a matrix)?  Yes!  Here are some slides that talk about the 1-D and 2-D peak-finding algorithms (my suggestion is to go up to slide 17)Orientation to Assignment 1  4:20pm - 4:25pmLet me show you the first assignment (due next Thursday).Turning in your work  4:25pm - 4:30pmPlease fill out the Canvas survey to complete your assignment for today.

This page has some [information on how to get started with accessing these student benefits](https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/student-pack/).## Hello WorldLet's work together to create our first Kotlin Program.  Open up IntellJ, select `File` then `New` then `Project`.Next, make sure you've selected  `Kotlin` as your language  and `Add sample code` should be checked.  Your JDK may look different from what is shown here, that's probably fine (but let me know if you run into issues).  For `Build System`, you can select any of them but Maven seems to work well in my experience).  See below for a screenshot of the new project dialog.![A screenshot of the IntelliJ IDE showing the selection of Kotlin as the programming language](/images/new_project.png)After you click `Create`, a window will open up with your new project.  It should look something like this.![A screenshot of the IntelliJ IDE showing the default project code](/images/configured_project.png).To run this program, click the arrow button near the `Current File` drop down.  You should get output that looks like this.```\"/Applications/IntelliJ IDEA.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home/bin/java\" -javaagent:/Applications/IntelliJ IDEA.app/Contents/lib/idea_rt.jar=61644 -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -Dsun.stdout.encoding=UTF-8 -Dsun.stderr.encoding=UTF-8 -classpath /Users/pruvolo/Downloads/HelloWorld/out/production/HelloWorld:/Users/pruvolo/.m2/repository/org/jetbrains/kotlin/kotlin-stdlib/2.2.0/kotlin-stdlib-2.2.0.jar:/Users/pruvolo/.m2/repository/org/jetbrains/annotations/13.0/annotations-13.0.jar MainKtHello, Kotlin!i = 1i = 2i = 3i = 4i = 5Process finished with exit code 0```You might be wondering what the red circle is for.  This is a breakpoint that would stop execution of your program if you were to run it under the debugger.  To test this out, click the icon of the bug (right next to the arrow).  IntelliJ will now look like this.![The IntelliJ debugger stopped a breakpoint](/images/debugger.png)Note that the values of the local variables are shown along with the line of code we are executing.  You can continue execution of the program using the ``resume program`` button.  For a more indepth look at the debugger, consult [the IntelliJ documentation on debugging](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/debugging-code.html).## Adding a Dependency on a LibraryThe process for adding a dependency on a third party library (e.g., to add some functionality not present in the Kotlin standard library) will depend on the build system.  Here is an example of how to add a dependency for the `Maven` build system (as selected in the previous section).  This should also work for `Gradle` as well.> Before getting started, configure IntelliJ to automatically download documentation and source for any imported dependencies.  You can do this by going to `Settings` -> `Build, Execution, & Deployment` -> `Build Tools` -> `Maven` -> `Importing` and then checking Automatically download `Sources`, `Documentation`, and `Annotations`.You can approach this in two ways.  First, you can do an ordinary Google search to find your dependency.  For example, if I want to do linear algebra things in Kotlin, I could search `Linear algebra kotlin library'.  From this list, I can usually find some instructions on how to add the library as a dependency.  Alternatively, you can search for the dependency you want to add using the official [Maven Search engine](https://search.maven.org/?eh=) or, if you want a more user-friendly experience, a community-managed [Maven Search Engine Alternative](https://mvnrepository.com/).  If I type in Linear Algebra to the site above, I get the following output.![The search output from mvnrepository.com](/images/maven_search.png)Next, I can pick the library I want by clicking on it and choosing a version.  Let's choose the EJML Simple Library and select the latest version (`0.44`).  There will be a selector to choose the build system you are using.  In our example of using Maven build system we can add the dependency by selecting `Maven` from the tabbed selector, copying the XML fragment (which should look like the following), and pasting it into the `` section of `pom.xml`.```xml    org.ejml    ejml-simple    0.44.0```You will need to click the `Reload` button to complete the process.To work with our dependency, let's modify our code.  If we know a type in the imported module we want to use, we can type it and the editor will automatically suggest the appropriate class to import.  Go ahead and add the following lines to the top of main ```kotlinval q = SimpleMatrix(3, 3)q[0,0] = 3.0print(q)```Initially, the word `SimpleMatrix` will be red since it is not imported.  You can right-click on it and select `Context Actions` and choose `Import SimpleMatrix`.  This will add the appropriate import at the top of your code.What does this code actually do?  Let's access the documentation.  If you click on SimpleMatrix, you should see a pop-up with documentation of what that command does (in this case it creates a matrix with all 0's).  You can further explore the documentation by interacting with the links in the documentation snippet.Some useful keyboard shortcuts for interacting with the documentation and discovering how external libraries work is as follows.* Search Everywhere: Shift Shift * Quick Doc (automatically show documentation in a sidebar): macOS F1 (or Ctrl+J), Win/Linux Ctrl+Q * Go to Declaration / Implementation: ⌘B / ⌥⌘B (Win/Linux Ctrl+B / Ctrl+Alt+B)* Show Usages: ⌥⌘F7 (Win/Linux Alt+F7)* Parameter Info: ⌘P (Win/Linux Ctrl+P)* Navigate Class / Symbol: ⌘O / ⌥⌘O (Win/Linux Ctrl+N / Ctrl+Alt+Shift+N)## A Note about Variation in SetupIf you would like to configure your workflow differently to these steps, that is totally fine.  I leave it to you to make this decision, and I'll do my best to support you should you run into road blocks.",

I haven't watched these (except for the first one of the 2024 series), but they were recommended by a student from last year.  One caveat here is that the examples use idiomatic solutions, which means that they prioritize using language-specific conventions and tricks to solve problems rather than using the most straightforward methods.  While this approach is nice to level-up your Kotlin skills, don't be intimidated that you would have used a different strategy to solve the problems.",
