The first assignment, is on the lighter side, but you should still be spending at least 6 hours on it.  If you finish this assignment in less than 6 hours, please consider one of the following additional activities.  Do some problems from Advent of Code in Kotlin (note: there is a link on the useful resources page to a walkthrough of these problems).  Expand the scope of the “translating old code to Kotlin” part of the assignment.  In the “Hello Kotlin” part of the assignment, try importing a dependency and using it in your code (the Setting up Kotlin section has some information on this).Course Entry SurveyPlease fill this out.  I want to get a better sense for what you are hoping to get out of this course, what your background is, and how I can make this course work well for you.Identifying Effective Strategies for LearningWhen embarking on a course, it’s important to strategize about how to get the most out of the experience.  One might focus on how to get the best grade, but I invite you to consider the task of trying to learn as much as possible as being the primary objective (and other rewards will follow from this goal).Respond to the following prompts to get you thinking about your approach to learning in this course.  Choose a moment in your educational career (it could be an assignment or a full course) where learning went really well. What strategies did you employ that worked particularly well (e.g., working with others, trying work on your own before asking a friend, going to office hours)?  Similar to (1), which sorts of strategies have led to either less effective learning or less enjoyment of the learning experience.  Feel free to describe a few examples of what doesn’t work for you.  As this course is foundational for many aspects of computer science, the problems in this class can be easily solved with modern AI systems (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.).  One of my foundational assumptions is the process of grappling with a problem helps you internalize the important concepts, gives you more insight into how the tools you are learning can be applied in other contexts, helps you more realistically assess your own abilities, and helps you learn to better communicate your knowledge to others.  Particular methods of using AI (e.g., prompting the AI to provide answers to questions and thoughtlessly copying the answers) are unlikely to achieve the learning goals articulated previously.  Do you agree with this framing? How are you thinking about AI tools with respect to this course?  What strategies will you use in this course to be successful?  With respect to AI, what principles or strategies will you use during this course.  What do you think of some of the proposed activities for the oral quizzes?  Are these activities ones that would give you helpful feedback as to how you are performing with respect to the course material?  Would you add or subtract any of the proposed activities?  How can the teaching team support you?Hello Kotlin!Read the section on the website about Getting Set with Kotlin.Go through the Kotlin tour (you only need to do the beginner Kotlin tour).  Make sure to attempt all the exercises in the tour.  What features do you like about Kotlin?  Are there things you were expecting to find that you haven’t?  What questions do you have?  Try using the debugger (see the Getting Set with Kotlin page) for some very basic information on the debugger.  Do you have experience using interactive debuggers like this one?  Were you able to successfully launch the debugger?  Turning in your work: You don’t have to turn in the code you write for the tour.  Please let me know that you did indeed finish the tour and turn in your answers to the questions above.Translating Your Old Code to KotlinChoose a piece of code that you’ve written in a programming language other than Kotlin.  Translate the code to run in Kotlin.  For simplicity, you may want to choose some code that will not require interacting with a lot of external libraries (although the course how-to discusses how to add dependencies to your project)The code you produce should be documented and contain at least some unit tests.  Turning in your work: Include a link to a GitHub repo containing your port of the code.  Include a writeup that describes the purpose of the code and how you found the process of translating the code to Kotlin (the good, the bad, and the ugly).",

        "content": "OverviewIn this assignment you will be implementing a doubly linked list in Kotlin.  You’ll then utilize your linked list class to create both a queue and a stack.  Once you’ve done that, you can use your newly minted data structures to solve some code-interview style problems.Part 1: Doubly Linked ListImplement a doubly linked list in Kotlin.  Your class should work with any data type (use Kotlin’s generics).  Your linked list should implement the following interface (we use T to refer to the data type stored in the underlying linked list).interface LinkedList&lt;T&gt; {    /**     * Adds the element [data] to the front of the linked list.     */    fun pushFront(data: T)    /**     * Adds the element [data] to the back of the linked list.     */    fun pushBack(data: T)    /**     * Removes an element from the front of the list. If the list is empty, it is unchanged.     * @return the value at the front of the list or nil if none exists     */    fun popFront(): T?    /**     * Removes an element from the back of the list. If the list is empty, it is unchanged.     * @return the value at the back of the list or nil if none exists     */    fun popBack(): T?    /**     * @return the value at the front of the list or nil if none exists     */    fun peekFront(): T?    /**     * @return the value at the back of the list or nil if none exists     */    fun peekBack(): T?    /**     * @return true if the list is empty and false otherwise     */    fun isEmpty(): Boolean}Make sure to include unit tests for each of these operations.  It’s okay if a single unit test simultaneously tests multiple of these functions.Stack and Queue Abstract Data TypesThe Stack abstract data type (ADT) can be represented by the following Kotlin interface.interface Stack&lt;T&gt; {    /**     * Add [data] to the top of the stack     */    fun push(data: T)    /**     * Remove the element at the top of the stack.  If the stack is empty, it remains unchanged.     * @return the value at the top of the stack or nil if none exists     */    fun pop(): T?    /**     * @return the value on the top of the stack or nil if none exists     */    fun peek(): T?    /**     * @return true if the stack is empty and false otherwise     */    fun isEmpty(): Boolean}The Queue abstract data type is:interface Queue&lt;T&gt; {    /**     * Add [data] to the end of the queue.     */    fun enqueue(data: T)    /**     * Remove the element at the front of the queue.  If the queue is empty, it remains unchanged.     * @return the value at the front of the queue or nil if none exists     */    fun dequeue(): T?    /**     * @return the value at the front of the queue or nil if none exists     */    fun peek(): T?    /**     * @return true if the queue is empty and false otherwise     */    fun isEmpty(): Boolean}Stack and Queue Implementations  Exercise 1: Using your linked list class as a data structure, create a class that implements the stack abstract data type.  Make sure to include unit tests to ensure your code is correct.  Since you are reusing your linked list class, you should not be implementing the stack operations from scratch (your functions should primarily be one-liners).  Exercise 2: Using your linked list class as a data structure, create a class that implements the queue abstract data type.  Make sure to include unit tests to ensure your code is correct.  Since you are reusing your linked list class, you should not be implementing the queue operations from scratch (your functions should primarily be one-liners).Practice Problems with Stacks and QueuesThese next problems are similar to the types of problems you might encounter in a technical interview.  You should work out a strategy for implementing all fo them, but you only need to implement one in Kotlin.  Exercise 3: How would you reverse the elements in a stack (i.e., put the elements at the top of the stack on the bottom and vice versa)?  You can use as many additional stacks and queues as temporary storage in your approach.  Exercise 4: Come up with a strategy to solve the valid parentheses problem.  Exercise 5: Solve the copy stack problem (source: University of Washington CSE122)  Given a stack return a copy of the original stack (i.e., a new stack with the same values as the original, stored in the same order as theoriginal). Your method should create the new stack and fill it up with the same values that are stored in the original stack.  You may use one queue as auxiliary storage.

        "content": "Let’s Settle In and Meet Each Other  Time 2:50-2:55pmCan we do a quick round of intros?  How about name, year, school, and where you’re from?Course Structure and Major Topics  Time: 2:55-3:05pmThe goal of this course is for you to learn how to frame problems using the language of computation and select appropriate data structures and algorithms to solve them.  We’ll get more into what we mean by framing problems later (there is an example later today), but for now I want to focus on the sorts of problems we will be tackling and the algorithmic strategies we will be using to solve them.Data Structures  Before talking about data structures, let’s talk about data.  What sorts data do we need to consider when designing computer algorithms?  Data structures as supports for algorithms.  Ultimately, data structures are useful to solve certain problems.  There are many properties we might care about when we select a data structure.  Can we brainstorm some of these properties as a class?  We’ll be learning about basic linked data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues), data structures to represent graphs and trees (e.g., binary search trees or heaps), and data structures that use hashing to index and retrieve data.Algorithmic Design PatternsWhile each algorithm must be tuned to the particular problem being solved, there are general algorithm types that we will encounter (e.g., some algorithms work by breaking a larger problem into smaller instances, some use a greedy approach, others are based on backtracking or graph search).Analyzing AlgorithmsWe want to develop ways to talk about the computational (how long it takes to compute a solution) and spatial (how much space is needed in a computer’s memory to compute a solution) complexity of algorithms.  We can look at these factors with both theoretical (e.g., doing some analysis to understand how long an algorithm runs based on the problem size) and empirical tools (e.g., measuring the actual time it takes an algorithm to run on a computer).Specific AlgorithmsOf course, we will learn about specific algorithms.  We’ll see algorithms from graph theory, string matching, bioinformatics, sorting, matrix multiplication, backtracking, and artificial intelligence.Applications of AlgorithmsWe’ll see some instances of how particular algorithms can be applied to solve problems in specific fields (e.g., text retrieval and indexing, bioinformatics).Algorithmic Deep DiveYou’ll be able to customize the course by taking a deep dive into a new algorithm or algorithms topic that we did not cover in the class.Implementation and TestingIn order to solidify your understanding of the material and improve your ability as a developer, we will be implementing many of our algorithms and data structures.  We’ll focus on creating unit tests as a way to create more maintainable and correct code.Algorithms in the World  Time: 3:05pm-3:30pmChoose a category of algorithms from the list below (or make up your own). You are not supposed to know all (or any) of these already!  I encourage you to choose ones you don’t know about and do some research. Alternatively, warm up with one you are familiar with and then choose one less so.  For each category you choose to look into:  What problem does the algorithm solve?  List the metrics that an algorithm designer might care about when creating an algorithm of this type.  List at least two examples of how algorithms of this type are used in the world (applications).Some examples of algorithms are listed below.  Data Compression (lossless or lossy)  Collaborative filtering (e.g., as used in recommender systems)  Encryption  Routing (e.g., of Internet traffic or for navigation instructions)  Task Assignment  Sorting  Matrix Multiplication  Fourier Analysis  Semantic search  (come up with your own…. there are so many!)  Bonus question: list all the algorithms that you and your team have interacted with since you got up this morning.Discussion of Learning Strategies and Oral Quizzes  Time: 3:30pm-3:50pmNext, I want to discuss two interrelated issues.  The first is how you can work in a way that best supports your learning this semester.  The second is how I can provide an assessment structure that provides you with useful feedback.While there are many aspects of assessment in this course, for now I want to focus on something new I’m trying this semester.  Twice this semester, I will meet with each of you for an oral quiz (each quiz is worth 10% of your grade).  My hope is that this structure will give you a better measurement of your progress over the semester.  Partially, my decision is based on mitigating what I feel are ways in which AI-based coding assistants might hinder learning in this course (e.g., if they are used as answer generators rather than coaches).  I’m not ready to nail down the full design of these quizzes, but here are some preliminary thoughts.            Activity      What’s Being Assessed              You are given a problem to solve. As you work towards a solution, you show / discuss your thought process.      Your ability to select appropriate data structures and algorithms to solve a novel problem.              You are asked to explain a section of code from one of your submitted assignments.      Your ability to internalize, and be able to verbalize to others, the coding choices you made.              You are asked to give a whiteboard talk explaining one of the class concepts.      Your fluency with the concepts in the course, your ability to distill down the important bits, and your ability to communicate clearly about course concepts.              You are given an implementation of a particular algorithm, and you must work through whether the code is correct. If it is not correct, you may suggest corrections.      Your ability to comprehend code that you didn’t write and assess its correctness.      With some folks around you, please discuss the following.  What are some learning strategies that have worked particularly well for you in the past?  Do you think they will work well in this course?  Will you use AI-based coding assistants in this course?  How will you use them to ensure you are getting the knowledge you’d like from the course?  In reaction to the table above, what other activities would be useful to include in an oral quiz and what skill would they be assessing?Having Some Fun With Algorithms  3:50pm - 4:20pmQuantifying RuntimeIn this class we’re going to be reasoning about the efficiency of our algorithms with respect to the size of the problem they are solving.  For instance, if we feed $n$ numbers into an algorithm, how long does it take the algorithm to compute a solution?  Depending on how the algorithm works, this might take $n^2$ (e.g., if we had to check all pairs of inputs against each other) or $n$ (e.g., if we only had to scan the inputs once).  In the problems below, you’ll want to come up with a procedure for solving the problem and also determine how many steps the algorithm would take to compute an answer as a function of $n$.  For the purposes of these exercises, the following operations take 1 step.  Accessing an element in a list (e.g., $a_2$)  Comparing two numbers to each other (e.g., $a_3 &gt; a_8$)Work through the peak-finding problem with a group of people sitting near you.  If you finish the first problem, you can either look into 2D peak-finding, or check out the first assignment.  The goal here is not for you to be able to jump right to the answer, but instead, to break down the problem and discuss it with those around you.Peak Finding  Credit to MIT Open Courseware 6.006 for this problemSuppose we have a list of numbers represented as a sequence $a_1, \\ldots, a_n$ with $n \\geq 2$.  For any element that isn’t either the first or the last element of this sequence, we say that element $i$ is a peak if and only if $a_i \\geq  a_{i-1}~\\text{and}~a_i \\geq a_{i+1}$.  For the elements at the ends of the sequence, we say that $a_1$ is a peak if and only $a_1 \\geq a_2$ and $a_n$ is a peak if and only if $a_n \\geq a_{n-1}$.With some folks around, you answer the following questions:Unpack the notation.  Write out a simple test case and label the values with the appropriate notation (e.g., write a list of numbers and draw an arrow to the first that says $a_1$, to the second that says $a_2$, etc.Get a feel for the condition written above.  Draw a few test cases.  When does a peak exist?  When does it not?Come up with a very simple algorithm to return the position, $i$, of a peak in a list of numbers (provided one exists).  As a function of $n$, how many elements do you have to check to determine if you have a peak?See if you can create an algorithm to find a peak faster than your first algorithm (faster in this case means it has a slower growing runtime as a function of $n$).  What techniques might be able to speed things up?  Make an argument that your algorithm is correct and see if you can start to understand how you might prove this more formally.Show / Hide Hint 1You should think about breaking the problem down into simpler instances.Show / Hide Hint 2Think recursively.  Here is a convenient link to the material from SoftDes on the matter (or call me over and we can do a quick refresher)!  What test can you perform that would allow you to recurse on a sequence half as large as the one you started with?If we changed the condition of a peak to the definition below, would your algorithm in question 3 still work?  Definition 2: For any element that isn’t either the first or the last element of this sequence, we say that element $i$ is a peak if and only if $a_i &gt; a_{i-1}~\\text{and}~a_i &gt; a_{i+1}$.  For the elements at the ends of the sequence, we say that $a_1$ is a peak if and only $a_1 &gt; a_2$ and $a_n$ is a peak if and only if $a_n &lt; a_{n-1}$.2D Peak Finding  Note: this is mostly just here for reference for the folks who are curious.  I do not expect you to be able to get to this during class time.Can we generalize the ideas from the peak-finding algorithm to 2 dimensions (i.e, a matrix)?  Yes!  Here are some slides that talk about the 1-D and 2-D peak-finding algorithms (my suggestion is to go up to slide 17)Orientation to Assignment 1  4:20pm - 4:25pmLet me show you the first assignment (due next Thursday).Turning in your work  4:25pm - 4:30pmPlease fill out the Canvas survey to complete your assignment for today.

Consider joining the Slack.Algorithm Design Patterns Whirlwind TourWe’re going to take a few classes to get a feel for the various algorithmic design patterns we will meet this semester.  During class 1, we met the design pattern divide and conquer.  Today, we’ll be learning about greedy algorithms.Wikipedia has a concise definition of a greedy algorithm.  A greedy algorithm is any algorithm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage.The question becomes, does the greedy strategy lead to an optimal solution to the problem?  In some cases it may lead to such a solution, and in other cases it may not.  Sample Problem Seeing where a greedy approach fails  To make sure we understand which problems can be solved with a greedy algorithm, it may be more intuitive to think about some cases that a greedy algorithm cannot solve. Let’s work through an example of this to all get on the same page.  Knapsack Problem: Given $N$ items where the $i$th item weights $w_i$ pounds, determine an assignment of items to two knapsacks such that the combined weight of the items in each knapsack is the same.  Example: There are five items with weights $6, 5, 9, 1, 1$.  Solution: Knapsack 1: ${5, 6}$, Knapsack 2: ${1, 1, 9}$.  What’s the greedy approach?  Let’s start with the knapsacks empty and choose the combination of knapsack and item that causes the total weight in each knapsack to stay as close as possible.  Let’s track how the knapsacks $K_1$, $K_2$, and the remaining items, $R$, would evolve over time if we applied this procedure.      $K_1 = [ 1 ], K_2 = [ ], R = [6, 5, 9, 1]$    $K_1 = [ 1 ], K_2 = [ 1 ], R = [6, 5, 9 ]$    $K_1 = [ 1, 5 ], K_2 = [ 1 ], R = [ 6, 9 ]$    $K_1 = [ 1, 5 ], K_2 = [ 1, 6 ], R = [ 9 ]$    $K_1 = [ 1, 5, 9 ], K_2 = [ 1, 6 ]$    This approach has clearly failed since the weights in $K_1$ total 15 and the weights in $K_2$ total 7.Now, let’s work through the following exercise as a group.  Exercise 1      Suppose you have a budget of $N$ dollars to purchase flour and that flour can be purchased on day $i$ for $x_i$ dollars per pound.  Determine the maximum amount of flour you can purchase with your budget.  Is your algorithm a greedy algorithm? (you can assume that buying a fraction of a pound is allowed).  How would you modify your algorithm if you were limited to purchasing $M$ pounds of flour each day?  Is the new algorithm greedy?    Determine a greedy algorithm for making change for $N$ cents using quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.  Does your greedy algorithm use the fewest coins possible (make an intuitive argument, no proof necessary)?    If the US began minting a 20-cent coin, would a greedy algorithm still solve the optimal change-making problem? (Wikipedia has some useful information on the change-making problem if you want to learn more)  Optimal Roadtripping  Exercise 2 You are planning a road trip of $N$ miles.  Your electric car has a range of $M$ miles.  There are charging stations located at mile $a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots, a_k$ (as measured from the start of the route).  Determine a procedure to figure out the minimum number of recharges you have to make in order to complete the road trip.  Show / Hide Hint 1  Start by thinking about the first decision you have to make (where to make your first recharging stop).  Is there a best first place to stop?  Show / Hide Hint 2  Assuming that you recharge completely each time you choose to stop, does it ever make sense to stop at an earlier charging station than you could have reached?O() and FriendsNext, we are going to return to what we did in the first class where we calculated the runtime of an algorithm as a function of the input size $n$.  Let’s say we compute the runtime of an algorithm 1 to be $2 n^2 + 5n + 200$ and the runtime of algorithm 2 to be $3 n^2 + 2 n$.  Is one necessarily faster than the other?  We can graph the two runtimes and see.Something interesting happens around $n=16$ (the lines cross).  However, if we let the input size get really large and plot the ratios of the two runtimes, we can see that algorithm 2 takes 50% longer to run than algorithm 1.The idea behind order of growth, is to find a way to draw meaningful distinctions between how fast functions increase.  Where meaningful in this case is based on how the functions behave when the input, $n$, gets very large and where we ignore constant factor differences in the functions (e.g., if a function is twice another, it is pretty much the same for our purposes).We say that $f(x) = O(g(x))$ if there exists a positive real number $M$ and a real number $x_0$ such that, $|f(x)| \\leq M g(x)~\\text{for all}~x\\geq x_0$.$f(x) = \\Omega(g(x))$ if there exists a positive real number $M$ and a real number $x_0$ such that, $|f(x)|\\geq M g(x)~\\text{for all}~x \\geq x_0$We say that $f(x) = \\Theta(g(x))$ if $f(x) = O(g(x))$ and $f(x) = \\Omega(g(x))$.Here is a handy figure from “Introduction to Algorithms” by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein.With your group, explain how the formal definitions (given earlier) relate to these pictures.  Exercise 3      Show that $10000 n = O(n^2)$ (let’s do this one together).    Show that $n^2 \\neq O(n)$.Show / Hide Hint      Write out the condition for $O()$ and show that it cannot be satisfied.        Show that $\\frac{3^n}{10000} = \\Omega(2^n)$Show / Hide Hint      Follow the blueprint by writing out the condition for $\\Omega$.  You don't have to necessarily find $x_0$, but convince yourself that one exists.        Argue (up to you how formal to make your argument) that any polynomial is $O(2^n)$    Exercise 4 This problem is from former Olin Professor Allen Downey’s Think Python second edition.   In this context, order of growth can be understood to mean $\\Theta$.  I made one modification to part 3 of the exercise.      What is the order of growth of $n^3 + n^2$? What about $1000000 n^3 + n^2$? What about $n^3 + 1000000 n^2$?    What is the order of growth of $(n^2 + n)(n + 1)$?    If $f$ is in $O(g)$ and $g$ is a continuously increasing functions that grows infinitely large as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$, what can we say about $af+b$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants?    If $f_1$ and $f_2$ are in $O(g)$, what can we say about $f_1 + f_2$?Show / Hide Hint      What do we know about based on the fact that $f_1$ and $f_2$ are in $O(g)$, can we write down a useful condition?        If $f_1$ is in $O(g)$ and $f_2$ is in $O(h)$, what can we say about $f_1 + f_2$?Show / Hide Hint      You can use max(g, h) to refer to the bigger of the functions.        If $f_1$ is in $O(g)$ and $f_2$ is $O(h)$, what can we say about $f_1 \\times f_2$?  Peak finding in KotlinLet’s create an implementation of the peak-finding algorithm we determined in class last time.  If you are not here for the live demonstration (or if we somehow run out of time), you can find the solution in the class sample solutions repo under Class01.",

        "content": "  Note: this is subject to changeMeeting Our First Data StructuresToday we’re going to meet our first data structures of the semester: the array and the linked list.  We’ll talk about tradeoffs in terms of runtime of various operations on these data structures.  We’ll also introduce the concept of abstract data types (ADTs) as a tool for separating the implementation of a data structure from the operations it supports.ArraysAs we mentioned on day one, data structures represent different approaches to organizing data in some digital storage system.  In this course, we’re going to learn about a bunch of different data structures (e.g., linked lists, arrays, binary trees, graphs, etc.).  To help us wrap our minds around the big ideas of data structures, let’s consider a very basic data structure: an array.Depending on your programming background, perhaps you haven’t encountered an array yet.  An array is an ordered collection of values (usually of a particular type).  Arrays are typically implemented in a computer using a contiguous block of memory (e.g., stored in the computer’s RAM).When we create an array, we have to specify the capacity that we’d like our array to have (that is the size that we’d like to reserve for our array in the computer’s memory).  Upon requesting an array of a particular size, we will be allocated a contiguous region in the computer’s memory to store our values.  We can assume that requesting and being assigned a region in memory is relatively efficient (think of this as taking a constant number of operations).  Further, we can assume that we can efficiently write and read values from an array (think of these as taking a constant number of operations).Time Complexity of Various Array OperationsAs stated above, for these operations we can assume that requesting new memory, reading a single value, and writing a single value for our array takes a constant number of operations.  Exercise 1: Suppose you have an array with $M$ elements and there is space for $C$ elements in the block of memory allocated to your array (with $M &lt; C$).  Assume that the $M$ elements are stored such that they occupy the first $M$ slots of memory allocated to the array.  How much time would it take to add a new element to the end of your array?  Exercise 2: Now, suppose you’d like to add an element to the beginning of your array.  If there are currently $M$ elements in your array, how many operations would it take to add an element to the beginning of the array?  Going back to our discussion of order-of-growth, what is the running time of this operations in terms of $\\Theta$?  Exercise 3: Now, suppose you want to add an element ot the end of your array but the number of elements stored in the array is equal to the current capacity $M = C$.  How many operations would it take to perform the following steps: request a size $M+1$ block of memory, copy the first $M$ elements to the new memory block, and then add the new element to the array?  Suppose you start $M = C = 1$ (an empty array with no capacity).  How many operations would it take to add $N$ elements to the end of this array if you added them one-by-one?  Determine $\\Theta$ of the time complexity of adding these $N$ elements.  Exercise 4: Similar to the previous problem, suppose you want to add $N$ elements to the end of an array in a one-by-one fashion.  Let’s see if we can do better than we did in problem 3.  Instead of adding 1 unit of capacity every time we run out of space in our array, we’re going to multiply our capacity by a factor of 2 (e.g., starting we start with capacity 1, then go to capacity 2, then capacity 4, and so on).  How many operations would it take to add $N$ elements to the end of this array if you added them one-by-one and follow the strategy of doubling the capacity of the array each time you run out of space (for simplicity you can assume that $N$ is a power of 2)?  Determine $\\Theta$ of the time complexity of adding these $N$ elements in this fashion.Linked ListsNext, we’re going to learn about a data structure that excels at many of the operations that arrays are slow at and lags behind in areas where arrays are fast.  This data structure is the linked list.A linked list is another way to represent an ordered collection of values.  Instead of storing our collection in a contiguous block of memory, instead we store data in nodes that each contain a value and a reference to both the next node and the previous node in our list (this sort of linked list is called a doubly linked list).  In addition to these nodes, we also maintain a reference to the first element (or the head of the linked list) and a reference to the last element (or tail of the linked list).  Let’s draw a picture of what this looks like on the board together.Now let’s do some problems to understand the time complexity of various operations on our linked list.  For the purposes of these exercises, let’s assume that we can request memory to store a new linked list node in constant time ($\\Theta(1)$).  Exercise 5: With folks around you, determine the time complexity ($\\Theta$) of each of these operations on a linked list:      Add an element to the beginning of the list    Delete an element from the beginning of the list    Add an element to the back of the list    Delete an element from the back of the list    Print out the middle element of the list    Exercise 6: A singly linked list is a linked list where each node only has a reference to the next element in the list.  In such a list, would the $\\Theta$ of any of these operations in problem 5 be different?  If so, which would be different and what are their new $\\Theta$ running times.Abstract Data TypesA common strategy for managing complexity in software is to separate the details of how a piece of software works (the implementation) from the functions that the software performs (the interface).  You may have seen this when you encountered object-oriented programming in Software Design.  When you created Python classes, you would define methods on those classes that could then be called to perform some operation.  The details of how these operations were carried out, were opaque to the caller (e.g., another class in our program).  In our study of data structures, we will make a similar distinction between the operations that a data type performs, and the specific underlying data structure that is used to implement this data type.We call the specification of a set of operations (or semantics) for a data type an Abstract Data Type (or ADT).  For instance, we might specify an ADT to represent an ordered collection with the following operations:  Insert at a new element at position $i$  Delete element at position $i$  Access element at position $i$  Append an element to the end of the list  etc.The actual implementation of this abstract data type (called a concrete data type) could use a linked list or an array (or something more exotic) as the underlying data structure.  Determining what concrete data type to use to implement a specific ADT will depend on the operations are most important for your application (you’ll want to make those fast).  Perhaps, you could even create different implementations of the same ADT for different use cases (e.g., if you care about accessing elements quickly or adding new elements).  Exercise 7: For example, the Python tutorial on lists states that while accessing elements in the list, appending an element ot the end of the list, or removing an element from the end fo the list is fast, adding or deleting an element at the beginning of the list is slow.  Based on what you worked out earlier in class, what underlying concrete data structure do you think Python uses for its list class?  Do some research to see if you are right.",

        "content": "## Install IntelliJ IDEWe'll be working with the [Kotlin language](https://kotlinlang.org/) (more information and history of the language available [through Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotlin_(programming_language)).  The best way to get Kotlin for your computer it install the IntelliJ IDE by JetBrains.  While you can use other IDEs with Kotlin (e.g., VS Code), we strongly recommend you stick IntellIJ (as that is the official IDE for Kotlin).  You can get a free license for Jetbrains since you are part of an academic institution.The [Getting Started page](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/getting-started.html) on the Kotlin website is the place to go to get started on your journey.  As you go through the instructions, make sure to click on the link that says ``IntelliJ IDE``.You should also take advantage of the fact that students can get free access to IntelliJ Ultimate.  This page has some [information on how to get started with accessing these student benefits](https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/student-pack/).## Hello WorldLet's work together to create our first Kotlin Program.  Open up IntellJ, select `File` then `New` then `Project`.Next, make sure you've selected  `Kotlin` as your language  and `Add sample code` should be checked.  Your JDK may look different from what is shown here, that's probably fine (but let me know if you run into issues).  For `Build System`, you can select any of them but Maven seems to work well in my experience).  See below for a screenshot of the new project dialog.![A screenshot of the IntelliJ IDE showing the selection of Kotlin as the programming language](/images/new_project.png)After you click `Create`, a window will open up with your new project.  It should look something like this.![A screenshot of the IntelliJ IDE showing the default project code](/images/configured_project.png).To run this program, click the arrow button near the `Current File` drop down.  You should get output that looks like this.```\"/Applications/IntelliJ IDEA.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home/bin/java\" -javaagent:/Applications/IntelliJ IDEA.app/Contents/lib/idea_rt.jar=61644 -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -Dsun.stdout.encoding=UTF-8 -Dsun.stderr.encoding=UTF-8 -classpath /Users/pruvolo/Downloads/HelloWorld/out/production/HelloWorld:/Users/pruvolo/.m2/repository/org/jetbrains/kotlin/kotlin-stdlib/2.2.0/kotlin-stdlib-2.2.0.jar:/Users/pruvolo/.m2/repository/org/jetbrains/annotations/13.0/annotations-13.0.jar MainKtHello, Kotlin!i = 1i = 2i = 3i = 4i = 5Process finished with exit code 0```You might be wondering what the red circle is for.  This is a breakpoint that would stop execution of your program if you were to run it under the debugger.  To test this out, click the icon of the bug (right next to the arrow).  IntelliJ will now look like this.![The IntelliJ debugger stopped a breakpoint](/images/debugger.png)Note that the values of the local variables are shown along with the line of code we are executing.  You can continue execution of the program using the ``resume program`` button.  For a more indepth look at the debugger, consult [the IntelliJ documentation on debugging](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/debugging-code.html).## Adding a Dependency on a LibraryThe process for adding a dependency on a third party library (e.g., to add some functionality not present in the Kotlin standard library) will depend on the build system.  Here is an example of how to add a dependency for the `Maven` build system (as selected in the previous section).  This should also work for `Gradle` as well.> Before getting started, configure IntelliJ to automatically download documentation and source for any imported dependencies.  You can do this by going to `Settings` -> `Build, Execution, & Deployment` -> `Build Tools` -> `Maven` -> `Importing` and then checking Automatically download `Sources`, `Documentation`, and `Annotations`.You can approach this in two ways.  First, you can do an ordinary Google search to find your dependency.  For example, if I want to do linear algebra things in Kotlin, I could search `Linear algebra kotlin library'.  From this list, I can usually find some instructions on how to add the library as a dependency.  Alternatively, you can search for the dependency you want to add using the official [Maven Search engine](https://search.maven.org/?eh=) or, if you want a more user-friendly experience, a community-managed [Maven Search Engine Alternative](https://mvnrepository.com/).  If I type in Linear Algebra to the site above, I get the following output.![The search output from mvnrepository.com](/images/maven_search.png)Next, I can pick the library I want by clicking on it and choosing a version.  Let's choose the EJML Simple Library and select the latest version (`0.44`).  There will be a selector to choose the build system you are using.  In our example of using Maven build system we can add the dependency by selecting `Maven` from the tabbed selector, copying the XML fragment (which should look like the following), and pasting it into the `` section of `pom.xml`.```xml    org.ejml    ejml-simple    0.44.0```You will need to click the `Reload` button to complete the process.To work with our dependency, let's modify our code.  If we know a type in the imported module we want to use, we can type it and the editor will automatically suggest the appropriate class to import.  Go ahead and add the following lines to the top of main ```kotlinval q = SimpleMatrix(3, 3)q[0,0] = 3.0print(q)```Initially, the word `SimpleMatrix` will be red since it is not imported.  You can right-click on it and select `Context Actions` and choose `Import SimpleMatrix`.  This will add the appropriate import at the top of your code.What does this code actually do?  Let's access the documentation.  If you click on SimpleMatrix, you should see a pop-up with documentation of what that command does (in this case it creates a matrix with all 0's).  You can further explore the documentation by interacting with the links in the documentation snippet.Some useful keyboard shortcuts for interacting with the documentation and discovering how external libraries work is as follows.* Search Everywhere: Shift Shift * Quick Doc (automatically show documentation in a sidebar): macOS F1 (or Ctrl+J), Win/Linux Ctrl+Q * Go to Declaration / Implementation: ⌘B / ⌥⌘B (Win/Linux Ctrl+B / Ctrl+Alt+B)* Show Usages: ⌥⌘F7 (Win/Linux Alt+F7)* Parameter Info: ⌘P (Win/Linux Ctrl+P)* Navigate Class / Symbol: ⌘O / ⌥⌘O (Win/Linux Ctrl+N / Ctrl+Alt+Shift+N)## A Note about Variation in SetupIf you would like to configure your workflow differently to these steps, that is totally fine.  I leave it to you to make this decision, and I'll do my best to support you should you run into road blocks.",
